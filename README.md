EavesDrop is a browser app for the GoneWildAudio subreddit. It's built with the Flutter framework.

It's currently available for Android, but since it's built with Flutter cross platform support is possible.

## Features
Features Include:
- GoneWildAudio Content Focused UI
- Tag Querying
- User Library

## Content
**All content featured on this app is directly streamed from r/gonewildaudio.**
EavesDrop is simply a client for it. All credit over any content featured on EavesDrop goes to its creator.

We do not own or re-host any of the content here:
- If a creator removes a post from r/gonewildaudio, **their post will not exist on EavesDrop as well.**
- If a creator edits a post from r/gonewildaudio, **their changes will immediately reflect on EavesDrop as well.**

**This app is just a client for r/gonewildaudio, meaning it reflects the content there exactly.** Any posts that do not exist on r/gonewildaudio will not exist on this app. Any edited posts will immediately change.

I hope this helps explain how this app functions better. If you have any additional questions, please be sure to ask! (you can see how [below](https://github.com/hiocas/EavesDrop#guidelines)).

## Roadmap

- Built In Audio Player

If I could get the right permissions for it, I'd love to have an in-app audio player which will hopefully support audio playlists and background notifications interactions.

- IOS Support

- Library Lists Creation and Management

- Home Sections Creation Management

- Comments Support

- Pushshift Api Integration (maybe)

Please note that this roadmap is not set in stone and features could be removed (or added...).
