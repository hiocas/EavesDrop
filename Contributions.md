## Voting
You can vote on existing feature request and improvements that you want to see implemented. This way we can know what features and improvements are the most important to the community and which ones aren't.

You can do so by heading to the [issues](https://github.com/hiocas/GWA-App/issues) page on the GitHub repo for this app and finding feature requests and improvements you like.

To sort issues by their votes, click on Sort and choose either 👍 or 👎.

Here's the link for [the issues with the most 👍.](https://github.com/hiocas/GWA-App/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)

You can also sort issues by their label. For new feature requests and feature improvements the relevant label is [enhancement.](https://github.com/hiocas/GWA-App/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Aenhancement)

You can filter issues by labels by clicking on the Label button and choosing the label you want to sort by.
